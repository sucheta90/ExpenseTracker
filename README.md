# Expense Tracker

An app build with React that helps keep a track of the monthly expenses. I did not build this project from scratch. Howeever the logics used

## Features

- This app shows a form that has three input fields for the expense **_Title_** , **_Amount_** and **_Date_**.
- OnClick event, the **_Add Expense_** will validate all input fields to check if all fields have data. If a field is found to be empty, the app will highlight the input field to indicate that by changing the backgroud color of the input field.
- If all information are entered correctly, the expense will be added to the list below.
- The app has date ranged between the year 2019 and 2023, hence the expense data will be saved to the year selected.
- The expense list has a Year filter and to see the expenses foe the setected year, user needs to select the Year from the dropdown.
- The app uses local memory.

### Project Goal

- I did not build this project from scratch. I used the layout(HTML and CSS) to practice writing codes to establish communication between different functional components.
- In this project I have learnt about **_State Hooks_** in React and it's uses.
- How **_props_** are being passed into functional components.
- How a State maintained in a Parent component can be used to manipulate the behaviour of the child components and how a communication is established between siblings.
- How to establish a two way bonding by using **_State Hook_**.
